"""Reproduction for the intermittent strict-receipt rejection on solved composites.

The luna variance run surfaced a close-out race: on multi-fault COMPOSITE
incidents the strict-receipt gate rejected a receipt whose incident the
mitigation oracle had SOLVED. Two facets were observed, both only on composites
(single-fault incidents settle in one closure, so the window never opens):

* Seed A / i07: ``completed=false`` while every detector was clear and the
  outcome was committed -- the gate sampled the durable responder result before
  it reached a terminal ``completed`` status.
* Seed B / i10: ``remaining_worktrees != []`` -- the gate sampled the shared
  worktree directory before the controller's asynchronous close-out had drained
  the incident's worktree.

Both are timing races: ``drain_pending_incident`` samples the receipt exactly
once, immediately after ``_wait_for_reflection_drain`` returns, and that drain
predicate (acknowledged + one relaunch-after-closure) does not guarantee the two
volatile close-out signals have settled. Composites open the window because they
chain follow-up responders and closure retries, so the predicate can fire during
an intermediate relaunch while the final close-out is still settling.

These tests drive the public ``drain_pending_incident`` with the in-memory
cluster fake and a seeded clock (no Kubernetes), reusing the chaos-pattern seam:
model a close-out signal that is unsettled at the instant the drain predicate
fires and settles a few polls later. The fix makes the drain wait for the
close-out to settle before it samples, so a solved incident is accepted.
