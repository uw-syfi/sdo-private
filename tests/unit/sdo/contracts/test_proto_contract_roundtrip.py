"""Stage 1 vertical slice of the proto single-source-of-truth track.

``controller/runtime/contract_proto_test.go`` encodes an ``ObjectRef`` through
the generated Go type and protojson, normalizes it, and writes
``tests/fixtures/sdo/contracts/proto/object_ref.json``. Here the generated
Python type parses that exact file, re-encodes it through the same canonical
protojson convention, and asserts the bytes are identical — the
Go-encode -> Python-decode -> re-encode -> identical round trip that makes a
schema drift between the two generated types a test failure.
