"""Deterministic synthetic token usage.

Every model response of a scripted turn gets usage computed from the
directive's seed, the turn kind and the response index, so a run's expected
totals are known exactly and each incident and turn kind is distinguishable
(a double-counted or dropped turn shows up as a mismatch, never as noise).

Stdlib-only: this runs inside the controller and responder images.
