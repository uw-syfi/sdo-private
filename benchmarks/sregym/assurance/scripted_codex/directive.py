"""What the scripted Codex CLI does for one incident.

The assurance harness writes one :class:`Directive` into the controller
namespace before it injects a fault. The first responder turn of an incident
binds the directive to the incident ID, so a restarted responder Job and the
later reflection turns replay the same plan even after the harness has moved
on to the next incident.

This module is stdlib-only: it runs inside the controller and responder images.
