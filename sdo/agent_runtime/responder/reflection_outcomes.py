"""Bounded outcome views for the reflection request.

Reflection is told about the incident it just closed and about earlier
incidents in the same memory. Serializing every ``OutcomeRecord`` whole costs
tokens in proportion to the operator's incident count: each record carries a
per-timestamp ``detector_history``, full finding evidence, and usage. That
text is re-read on every model request of the reflection session. These views
keep what learning is grounded in (findings, root causes, repairs, playbooks,
detector transitions) and drop repeated evaluations and, for past incidents,
raw evidence.
