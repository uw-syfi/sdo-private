"""Responder-side cause-admissibility gate.

SDO's responder proposes confirmed root causes for an incident. The
controller's deterministic ``verify_diagnosis`` later checks each proposed
cause against controller-owned facts (contradiction, explained-detector
flips, and repair attribution). That verifier is fenced: it is the
authoritative check and is deliberately left untouched here.

This module is strictly *upstream* of the verifier. It improves the quality
of the evidence the responder asserts, so a weakly-evidenced cause is not
emitted as a confirmed root cause in the first place. It can only *remove*
causes the responder proposed; it never relaxes, duplicates, or substitutes
for the verifier, and it can never cause a confirmation the verifier would
not otherwise make.

Admissibility is decided only from the production contracts (the responder's
own :class:`~sdo.contracts.IncidentResult` and the controller's
:class:`~sdo.contracts.IncidentRequest`). It inspects evidence *kinds* and
whether an explained detector actually fired for this incident; it never
reads benchmark verdicts and encodes no fault-specific knowledge.

The rule is intentionally conservative, so it cannot drop a genuine cause
(including every component of a real composite): a cause is withheld *only*
when its entire evidentiary basis is unverifiable narrative. Concretely, a
cause is admissible when either

- it cites at least one piece of evidence of a *corroborating* kind
  (``detector-finding``, ``synthetic-traffic``, or ``state-change``) that an
  independent check could anchor to an incident signal, or
- it names at least one ``explained_detector`` that actually fired for this
  incident.

A cause that rests only on ``live-observation`` items -- which the contract
documents as "accepted as live but unverified" -- and explains no detector
that fired is weakly evidenced and is withheld.
