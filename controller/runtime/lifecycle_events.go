// The incident lifecycle event stream makes SDO's internal lifecycle coherently
// observable. The detector firing stream records whether and when detectors
// fired; this stream records the controller's own incident lifecycle
// transitions -- when an incident opened, when its worktree was prepared, when
// the responder was dispatched and completed, when a follow-up superseded it,
// when a stranded worktree was released, and when the incident closed, its
// outcome committed, and the closure was acknowledged. Joined by incident id
// (and, for firings, the same id field), the two streams plus the outcome commit
// each closure_committed event names let an operator reconstruct one incident's
// full timeline offline from durable artifacts alone.
//
// Like the firing stream, it is operational telemetry, not operational memory:
// it never enters .sdo/, carries no benchmark labels or verdicts, and is derived
// only from the controller's own deterministic lifecycle state. Every field is a
// controller-internal fact (incident ids, git commit shas, worktree paths,
// finding keys); nothing here is transport- or benchmark-specific.
